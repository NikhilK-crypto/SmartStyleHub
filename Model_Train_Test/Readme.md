## Train & Test Notebook 

<p>
In Above file we have fine tuned CLIP Model with the H&M dataset.<p><p>
After training the model we took unique images from our training dataset and did calculated the R-Precision Score. R-Precision Score for the Finetuned Model is better than the Basse pretrained model
Base model is trained on 4 millions images<p><p>
Finetunned model is slightly better than base model.
