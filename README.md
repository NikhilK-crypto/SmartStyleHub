# SmartStyleHub

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient platform that simplifies the process of
outfit selection by offering personalized style suggestions. Specifically, our system utilizes NLP techniques to
interpret user queries, extracting relevant keywords such as occasions ("interview," "casual outing") and clothing
preferences ("men," "formal"). Additionally, the system integrates methods to search through a vast database of
images featuring clothing items from renowned brands like H&M. By combining these technologies, the system
effectively bridges the gap between user queries and visual representations of recommended outfits, offering a
seamless and interactive experience.

The project focuses on implementing a chatbot-style interface capable of understanding natural language queries
related to fashion and providing visually appealing recommendations. The system will prioritize user input, analyzing
keywords to identify specific clothing needs and occasions. Moreover, the integration of Computer Vision algorithms
will enable the system to retrieve relevant images from the database, showcasing attire from recognized brands such
as H&M. However, it's important to note that the system's recommendations will be based solely on the information
provided by the user and the available database content. Future iterations of the project may explore additional
features, such as real-time image recognition or personalized styling tips based on user preferences and feedback.
